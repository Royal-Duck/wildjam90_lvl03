The war is over, we lost, and I am going home. My country is in ruins. I meet survivors and I have to fight to stay alive. I lie to those who ask how I made it out; some recognize me, I used to be a high-ranking officer. I believed in the cause of this war. I arrive home and find my mother. I confess to her. After years of war, I understood that my king was a tyrant. It had to stop. I killed him. I return home in shame: I fed this war, and in the end I betrayed my nation. I carry two kinds of guilt: I supported it, and I betrayed it. I also ended the war.
